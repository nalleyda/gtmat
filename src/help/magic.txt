Inputs:
    1. numeric value (double)

Outputs:
    1. "magic" array (double)

Format:
    arr=magic(num)

Description:
    Generates a magic square. Given input "num", outputs a square array 
including every integer 1 through num^2, in an order such that values in each 
row, column, and main diagonal have the same sum.

Example:
    arr=magic(3)
    %arr= [ 8     1     6
    %       3     5     7
    %       4     9     2 ]

Note:
    As you can see, thesum of each row, column, and main diagonal is the same 
(in this case: 15).
