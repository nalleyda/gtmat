% 16.1	On the following list of attributes, check all that apply to both quick sort and merge sort:
% •	Defined recursively
% •	O(N2)
% •	Linear search
% •	Requires an array
% •	Second law of thermodynamics
% •	O(NlogN)
% •	Defined iteratively
% •	Binary search
% •	Requires a collection with random access
% 
% 16.2	Divide and Conquer strategy: Which sorting algorithm makes use of a pivot when sorting?
% 16.3	Sort the following array using the algorithms listed below. Show all of the vectors (excluding the empty ones) created at each step.
% [5 4 10 2 9 6 3 7 8 1]
% •	Using merge sort
% •	Using quick sort
% •	Using insertion sort
% •	Using bubble sort
% 16.4	Write and test an in place version of merge sort that makes use of the global array, b.
% 16.5	Adapt the quick sort in place algorithm to operate on a cell array of strings sorting the strings alphabetically ignoring case. You will need to adapt the generic comparison functions to include comparing alphabetically.
% 16.6	Adapt the bubble sort algorithm to operate on a structure array, one of whose fields is called “name.” Sort the structures alphabetically by the name field ignoring case. You could use the generic comparison functions previously adapted to include comparing alphabetically.
% 16.7	Write a script that will take a structure array and sort it using the internal MATLAB sort(…) algorithm. It should request the name of a field in the structure array containing numerical data, and sort the array based on the contents of that field. You could use the CD collection from Chapter 10 and sort it on the value or stars fields, for example.
